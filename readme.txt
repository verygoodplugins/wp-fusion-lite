It does not apply tags based on purchases or course activity, sync form entries, sync customers, or detect any data generated by other plugins.

= Benefits =

* ⚡ Replace Zapier, Integromat, and other integration tools. WP Fusion gives you a direct data sync between your site and your CRM, with no delays or limits.

* 🔒 Create easy to manage membership sites with drip-released content using timers and logic in your CRM.

* 💎 Personalize your site by displaying data from CRM contact records, and showing / hiding content based on a user's CRM tags or lists.

> WP Fusion allows us to provide tailored customer experiences in WordPress that wow every time.

> Hundreds of plugins that used to be one size fits all, can now perform differently for each Ontraport contact. For example, a low scoring Ontraport contact can be presented with a winback customer journey in WordPress.

> This has allowed our clients to increase customer engagement and retention. It's the only solution that should be considered for any WordPress integration.

> WP Fusion is one of my secret weapons for getting WordPress to keep our member's data synced with our CRM. This makes everything work so much better when you don't have to worry about your members having issues logging into the member's area.

> If you have or are considering having a membership website using WordPress this plugin is a must-have. It will save you hours of time and frustration.

== Installation ==

Upload and activate the plugin, then go to Settings >> WP Fusion. Select your desired CRM, enter your API credentials and click "Connect" to verify the connection.

For CRM-specific setup information, see our [Installation Guide](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/installation-guide/?utm_campaign=free-plugin&utm_source=wp-org).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is it for? =

WP Fusion is built for anyone using a [CRM or marketing automation platform](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/crm-compatibility-table/?utm_campaign=free-plugin&utm_source=wp-org), and running their website with WordPress.

CRMs empower businesses to track leads, send email broadcasts, manage contact data, track sales, delegate client relationships between employees, and more.

WordPress handles the public facing side of your business: your sales pages, ecommerce platform, support forums, photos and videos, and anything else you want the world to see.

**But your CRM and WordPress don’t talk to each other.**

**This is where WP Fusion comes in.**

WP Fusion acts as a bridge between your WordPress data and CRM data— it allows you to use data from WordPress to power your marketing campaigns, and data from your CRM to personalize the customer experience in WordPress.

= How is it different from Zapier? =

While WP Fusion and Zapier are both integration tools, they work quite differently.

Zapier is a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution that acts as a middleman between your site and your CRM (as well as many other platforms).

When something is updated in WordPress, it is synced to Zapier’s website, and then Zapier syncs the data on to your desired platform. Depending on your plan there is a delay before the data is synced, and/or limit on how many “tasks” you can run each month.

**WP Fusion connects your site directly to your CRM or marketing automation platform** over the API (nothing goes through our website). Because of this the sync of data is instant, secure, and there are no monthly limits.

In addition to syncing data with your CRM, WP Fusion also includes many options for [protecting your WordPress content based on CRM tags](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/access-control/?utm_campaign=free-plugin&utm_source=wp-org), and triggering changes in membership level or course enrollments based on CRM automations. This generally isn’t possible with Zapier because Zapier is configured via zapier.com, not inside your WordPress dashboard.

= Why are your version numbers so funny? =

WP Fusion Lite is a copy of the Pro WP Fusion plugin, with support for third-party plugins removed. Each time we release a Lite update, it brings it up to date with the latest version of the Pro plugin. For the full details [see the changelog on our site](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/faq/changelog/?utm_campaign=free-plugin&utm_source=wp-org).

= Can I disable the upgrade nags? =

WP Fusion Lite has a few banners on the settings pages with additional info about the features available in the Pro version.

If you'd prefer not to see these you can disable them with the filter:

`add_filter( 'wp_fusion_hide_upgrade_nags', '__return_true' );`

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wp-fusion-lite)

= Do you have more FAQs? = 

Of course, see our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://wpfusion.com/documentation/).
